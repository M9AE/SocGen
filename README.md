# SocGen

This project is inspired by the logic and memory tests used in the recruitment processes of some companies in the financial sector. It is not intended to replicate them but rather to transform them into a game accessible to everyone who would like to play.

## Structure

Currently, you can find two games:
*  A simple memory game where you have to remember the positions and the sequence of the points' appearances.
*  A memory and logic game where you need to recall the positions and sequence of appearances and also determine whether the figure is symmetric.

## How to use it

You might need the library Imagine++ used in this projest.
You can find it here : https://imagine.enpc.fr/~monasse/Imagine++/

I hope you will like it !
